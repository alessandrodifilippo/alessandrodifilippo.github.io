Ciao!

I am Alessandro, a second-year PhD student in Economics at the **ifo Institute** and **LMU** (Munich, Germany).

My interests are in **labor** and **gender economics**, but I'm generally curious about anything gravitating around applied microeconomics!

You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/Curriculum%20ADF.pdf). For anything you cannot find there, feel free to reach out!

📫 _difilippo /at\ ifo.de_
